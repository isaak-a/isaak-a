Hi, I'm Isaak! That's two `a`'s and a `k`! :grin:

I love to code, and I particularly love anything data related! I also love tennis, fantasy novels, and pretending my Chihuahua Loki is a rubber duck. 

Welcome to my GitHub account! If you're looking around, check out: 

- [Law School Debt Calculator](https://github.com/isaak-a/LS-debt-calculator)
  * This is a project I built while a friend was applying for Law School! Turns out it's pretty expensive. They asked for my help comparing/estimating costs, and I thought some others might get some use out of it too.  
- Other Projects! 
  * Ok most of my other projects on here are currently private - I'm self-conscious, sue me! Working on making them more presentable.
